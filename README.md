## **ECS Sim Coursework**
ACHIEVED: 97%
## **Overview**
This repository contains my implementation of the ECS Sim coursework project, which is my first ever coursework. The objective of the project was to create a virtual representation of a university, named "EcsSim". The simulation includes various facilities and staff contributing to the growth and success of the university.

## **Coursework Objectives** 
The key objectives of this coursework were to:

- Construct simple classes and implement methods.
- Convert pseudo-code descriptions into working Java code.
- Develop a program capable of performing a complex task.
- Demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Correctly use polymorphism, exceptions, and I/O operations.
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
## **Project Specifications**
The aim was to follow a detailed specification to build a simplified simulation of a university. The main components of the university included:

- Halls: Facilities providing accommodation for students.
- Labs: Facilities for laboratory sessions to train students in practical skills.
- Theatres: Facilities for lectures to impart theoretical knowledge.
- Staff: Individuals responsible for instructing students in labs and lectures.
The primary goal was to build facilities and hire staff using "EcsCoins" (the simulation currency) to create a successful university. The university gains reputation and EcsCoins by teaching students effectively.

## **Key Features**
- Object-Oriented Design: Implementation of classes and methods following OOP principles.
- Polymorphism and Inheritance: Use of polymorphism to enhance code flexibility and reuse.
- Exception Handling: Proper management of errors and exceptions.
- Input/Output Operations: Efficient handling of data input and output.
- Good Coding Practices: Writing readable, maintainable, and well-documented code.
## **Conclusion**
This coursework project was a comprehensive exercise in object-oriented programming and Java development, focusing on building a complex system from a detailed specification. The completed EcsSim demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and document a functional simulation of a university.
